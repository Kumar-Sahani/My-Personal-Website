      <h3>Speaking the Patterns of the Universe.</h3>
      <p>During my schooling, I have been told to be the dumbest kid in the class or at least that is what the teachers believed and told my parents.</p>
      <p>I was the silent kid during my schooling and I don't remember having an achievement or an appreciation from anyone.</p>
      <p>For me, reading the simplest word in English, Telugu, Hindi or even in my own mother tongue was the hardest part; but to my joy, I would simply stare at the Nigth Sky or sometimes I would stare hours admiring the beauty of the other things like the wall, trees, blank paper and my English teacher.</p>
      <p>And during these times, my mind became a bit creative but I didn't realise it until the last years of my High schooling, were Teachers started believing in me. And somewhere that small belives changed me completely:From consistently failing the grades to being able solve problems that aren't solvable by my maths sir(Principal, M.tech in mathmatics). </p>
      <p>I started designing things as an escape from childhood trauma, but it eventually helped me realise my creativity.</p>
      <p>Right now, I design protypes of my own invention like Artificial Muscles, One-Wheel devices, ILE(a device that would help to pilot the entire planet)and sometimes Artistic related stuff.</p>
