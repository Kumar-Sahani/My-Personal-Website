      <h3>An Ordinary Guy trying to be the Best Version of Himself</h3>
      <p>Hi! I'm Kumar, I'm 20, I was born and raised in Hyderbad, a city in Telangana, India; but my native place is Uttar Pradesh. I'm all about Astronomy and learning new things. </p>
      <p>I always wanted to be in the technical field, which is why I got into the Engineering(Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, B.tech). I like making and Designing things, such as Arduino based projects, Front-end and Back-end web WebDevelopment.</p>
      <p>Besides my Technical interests, I'm also a Novelist and a Poet.</p>
      <p>Few of my school buddies call me an Alien because of addiction that I have towards Astronomy, but I'm one hundread percent a Human.</p>
      <p>Talking of my Family background, my Dad's a Carpernter and my Mom is a Housewife, both of them are my idiols. And also I'm blessed with 3 annoying siblings; among them, my elder brother is an Architect, My elder sister is a Docotr and my younger sister is pursing her degree in B.com.</p>
      <p>I'm the R.J of the campus radio of my collage, I go by the name: R.J Kumar. Due to the constantly participation into the social event, my public speaking skills have been drastically improved over the decay.</p>
      <p>So far I have participated in a 36-hour Hackathon, there I have won and earned the "Certificate of Appreciation" and also an Ethical Hacking and Cyber Security Internship at Supraja Technologies(Stipend).</p>
      <p>The biggest flaw I have is that if I get an interest into something new, I wouldn't hesitate wasting my time doing the research about it, even if it is a day before my Final exams.</p>
      <p>I got a creativity mind and I'm an average student.</p>
